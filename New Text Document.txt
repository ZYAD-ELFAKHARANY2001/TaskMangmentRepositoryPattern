Step 6: Implement Registration and Login

Create controllers and services to handle user registration and login. Use Entity Framework Core to store user information in the PostgreSQL database. The registration process should collect user data such as name, email, phone, password, and a profile picture.

Step 7: Create Controllers for Tasks

Develop controllers for managing tasks. This includes creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks. You should also implement logic for handling task assignments and status changes.

Step 8: Implement Admin Features

Create an admin controller or extend existing controllers to provide admin functionality. Admins should be able to view all tasks in the system, delete tasks, and change task statuses.

Step 9: Implement Repository Pattern

Implement the repository pattern to separate data access logic from your controllers and services. Create repository classes that encapsulate data operations and interact with the database. Use dependency injection to inject repositories into your controllers and services.

Step 10: Implement Task Search and Ordering

Implement search and ordering features for tasks. Users should be able to filter and sort tasks based on due dates. This requires adding query parameters to your API endpoints and applying appropriate filtering and sorting logic.

Step 11: Implement Swagger/OpenAPI

Integrate Swagger or OpenAPI for documenting your API. These tools automatically generate API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with your API. Swagger also provides a user-friendly interface for testing API endpoints.

Step 12: Test and Deploy

Thoroughly test your application, including unit tests and integration tests. Once testing is complete and your application is free of bugs, you can deploy it to your preferred hosting environment. Common hosting options for .NET Core applications include Azure, AWS, or on-premises servers.

Each of these steps is a building block in creating your .NET Core API application with PostgreSQL and the specified features. Depending on your project's complexity, some steps may require more time and effort than others. Be sure to consult official documentation and tutorials for your technology stack to gain a deeper understanding of each step.
